# Crustagen ü¶Äüîê

## Description

Crustagen is a password generation program written in Rust. It makes use of command line arguments to supply information to the program. It was created using VSCode and the cargo tool. In coming versions, I hope to implement saving passwords to an encrypted file, passphrase generation from a wordlist, an interactive TUI mode, exporting to JSON for APIs, and custom character sets.

## How to Install and Run Crustagen

There are currently two ways to install Crustagen, with a method to install using a PPA being currently in development.

### Curl

1. Input the below command into your terminal emulator of choice

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/glapsuidir/crustagen/master/install.sh | bash
```

2. The install script will start automatically
3. Check to ensure crustagen is present in $PATH by running ‚Äòecho $PATH‚Äô

### Manual Compilation

1. Navigate to github.com/glapsuidir/crustagen
2. Download the binary or source code
3. Navigate to the directory the files were downloaded in and extract if necessary
4. If compiling from source, use cargo build from the project directory
5. Run the command below to add the binary to your PATH variable

```bash
cp crustagen /usr/local/bin
```

## How to Use Crustagen

Crustagen is run and used from the command line. After installing and adding binary to your PATH variable, you can run it using ‚Äòcargo‚Äô. Otherwise, locate the crustagen binary, and run it directly (such as /home/skywalker/crustagen).

### Flags

- -d or --verbose: Controls verbose mode to show more information on command execution
- -l or --length: Manually sets length of password (default 12)
- -s or --special: Adds special characters to the charset used to generate the password
- -v or --version: Displays the installed version number
- -h or --help: Displays help information
